Uber Fare Prediction
Objective
The objective of this project is to design an algorithm which will tell the fare to be charged for a passenger.
Problem Statement
A fare calculator helps a customer in identifying the fare valid for the trip. They are often used by passengers who are new to a city or tourists to get an estimate of travel costs. 
You are provided with a dataset with features like fare amount, pickup and drop latitude,longitude, pickup datetime, and so on.
Dataset
Here, you are provided with a train dataset with more than 5M observations. There are 8 columns in the dataset as follows:
key
fare_amount
pickup_time
pickup_longitude
pickup_latitude
dropoff_longitude
dropoff_latitude
passanger_count
Steps
Inorder to generate the machine learning models, the following steps were taken on the dataset provided:
Load a sample of the train dataset
Convert the pickup_time to a DateTime format.
Check for the unusual values. For example, the pickup_longitude and latitude had some large values. Similarly, there was some negative fare amounts in the dataframe.
Drop observations where the latitudes and longitudes are not in the decided ranges.
Check for missing values and drop the rows with missing values.
Extract days, weekdays, month and years from the datetime column.
Calculate distance from the dropoff and pickup latitudes and longitudes.
Drop observations where the distance is zero.
Machine Learning Models
Since this is a regression problem, we have used few models :Linear Regression,Random Forest Regression and XGBoost Regression models.
To measure the performance of the models, we used the Root Mean Squared Error
XGB Regression,with RMSE(XGB RMSE: 2.7679176885517296),performed better than Random Forest (RMSE: 2.806420527877298) 
Linear Regression (LR RMSE: 4.2948927509005586) and hence we chose it as our final model.
